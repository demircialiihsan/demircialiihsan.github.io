									<h3>My First Game</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I started coding with <b>Unity and C#</b> during high school, and
									alongside my brother Said—an excellent 3D modeler and UI artist—we
									published our first game on Android during the summer before I began my
									Bachelor's in <b>Computer Engineering</b> at Istanbul Technical
									University in 2017. While the game is no longer available on the market,
									I recently uploaded it to <a href="https://demircialiihsan.itch.io/lunar-space-adventure" target="_blank">here</a>
									on itch.io for anyone who wants to check it out. Fair warning: I haven't
									touched it since the initial release almost a decade ago, and it's really
									hard to play!
								</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Working at Garawell Games</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									During university years, I had the opportunity to work at the well-known
									<b>Garawell Games</b>, where I contributed to the very first prototype of
									what later became the widely recognized <b>"Bridge Race"</b>. Over time,
									I worked on <b>more than 10 hypercasual prototypes</b>, gaining valuable
									experience collaborating with fellow developers and artists.
								</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Co-founding Margin Games</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									After building my skills, I co-founded <b>Margin Games</b> with two
									partners. We started with a <b>casual word game</b> that featured a board
									and explosion mechanics similar to match-3 games. Through this
									experience, I gained hands-on knowledge of <b>working with publishers</b>,
									optimizing <b>creatives</b>, improving <b>D1 retention</b> to <b>over
									40%</b>, <b>maintaining a live game</b> with updates, and running
									<b>monetization tests</b>.
								</p>
								<p>
									From there, we shifted to <b>hypercasual</b>
									games, partnering with <b>leading publishers</b> and testing about
									<b>20</b> different projects. As the market evolved, we transitioned into
									<b>hybrid-casual</b> games, which proved to be a great move—one of our
									titles, "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MarginGames.MergeJump2048" target="_blank">Happy Cubes - 2048</a>", reached <b>soft launch phase</b>
									after strong initial test results, ultimately hitting <b>48.5% D1
									retention</b>. Today, the game has reached nearly <b>100,000 downloads
									only on Android</b>.
								</p>
								<header>
									<h3>The Next Step...</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Now, I decided to open a new chapter in my career. I want to make a
									bigger impact, apply my skills <b>where they matter most</b>, and
									<b>contribute more</b> as I continue growing as a game developer.
									<br>
									So… what’s next?
